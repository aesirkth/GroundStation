`lps_control.py`

The LPS Control GUI is extremely simple.

Click on "Open link" to open the Serial connection to to LPS Gateway. Click on the buttons to send the desired command. The state of the button changes accordingly to the reply from the Launch Pad Station Board. For example, once "Start filling" is pushed and the rocket fuel filling is initiated, the button will turn to "Stop filling"
