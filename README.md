# Ground Station

This software is intended to read the data received by the receiver in real time and display it in a clear way to follow the flight parameters.

# Functionalities

This software should :

* [ ] Read the raw data from serial connection
* [ ] Convert the raw data from sensors
* [ ] Record all the received data for future utilisation
* [ ] Display the following values in real time (time related curves if possible)
  * [ ] Altitude
  * [ ] Pressure
  * [ ] Speed
  * [ ] GPS position
  * [ ] Engine status
  * [ ] ...


*Tick the tasks once successfully implemented and tested*

It is assumed that the sensors' data is not processed in any way by the embedded computer. The data received is raw and should be converted to readable values by the ground station.

>NB : how do we deal with the calibration of the sensors ?

# Hardware
